# Wallpaper Himmel

Python project to teach myself the usage of `beautifulsoup` and comparable libraries for webscraping and work with `HMTL` and `XML` based data/code.

Goal is to write python code that downloads wallpaper from wallhaven based on keywords.

## Future Dev Goals

- only download new wallpaper/not yet downloaded
- Filtering 
- Tags
- Colours
- Resolutions/ratios
